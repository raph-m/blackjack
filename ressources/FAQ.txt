# FAQ

## DO WE HAVE TO SUBMIT OUR CODE?

You should include a link in the report to your code. This should be sufficient.
But to be sure (that your code is recorded / that there are no issues with the
link), you can submit a copy (in .zip) to Moodle along with the final version 
of your report.


## ARE WE GRADED ON OUR CODE?

Your grade is not affected by the quality of your code. However, you are graded
on the reproducibility of your results: your code should be available and
working, and executable using any of the technologies/libraries from the labs. 

It is recommended to include a demo script to run at least a part of your code
with the least effort possible.

You can borrow as much code from elsewhere as you wish but YOU MUST acknowledge
this. Obviously if you 'borrowed' a lot of code from somewhere you would be
expected to make a relatively more sophisticated analysis to compensate.


## HOW CAN WE MAKE CODE AVAILABLE ANONYMOUSLY? 

There are several ways to create an anonymous link to code. If you don't find
one which suits your needs, simply send a zip file to one of the teaching team 
with your code and we can make an anonymous link for you to add to your report. 


## WHAT IS THIS ALIFE ENVIRONMENT? WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS?

You can adapt and apply your agent to this environment, and explain the results. 
In one of the labs, we demo this environment. If your chosen/designed agent
cannot be adatped for this environment - simply explain why.


## WE HAVE AN IDEA OF AN AGENT/ENVIRONMENT FOR THE PROJECT - IS IT SUITABLE?

Indeed, it is good to check first if an idea is feasible if you are not sure. 
Send an email to, or approach one of the teaching coordinators during the labs.
