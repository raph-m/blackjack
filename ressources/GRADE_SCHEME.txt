# Grading Guidelines for the Report

The following is an indication of how the project will be graded. You will also
be given feedback on your report. 

NOTE: the following is provided in the context of providing more information 
about writing the report and doing the project; it is separate from to the 
review form (review.txt) that you will follow when commenting on other work.


Of 70 available points:

## [15 points] Background material and presentation 

	 The report should be easy to follow for someone who is familiar with the
	 lecture material; the relevant background material for understanding the
	 report should be clearly and correctly explained, and any closely-related
	 existing agent/environment setups should be mentioned/cited. The report
	 should not go over the page limit.

## [10 points] The environment 

	Suitability of the environment. Novelty, difficulty, implementation,
	understanding. If the environment is not novel, more emphasis should be
	placed on understanding of its challenges, etc.

## [10 points] The agent 

	Suitability to environment (choice of agent), design, implementation,
	parameterization, understanding.

## [25 points] Results and discussion 

	Show understanding and interpretation of results. Explaining/demonstrating
	the strengths and weaknesses of the agent, the problems posed by the
	environment; via tables, graphs, etc. 
	
	This includes 5 points for the application to the ALife environment: a
	paragraph or two of explaining the (non-)applicability of your agent is
	the minimum expectation for this. 

	Note: this includes availability of code, and ability to reproduce results.
	You are highly encouraged to include a README file and a demo script. 

	Either in the README file, or in the report, you must outline which parts of
	your code are original and which parts you credit from elsewhere. 

## [10 points] Bonus points.

	A (maximum) number of points distributed to the best aspects of the report.
	For example, if you made an special effort on the design of an environment,
	or if you made an in-depth analysis on deployment to the ALife environment.
